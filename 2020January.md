# January Kata 2020

<http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2017/10/02/user-authentication-kata-with-elixir-and-phoenix/>

I thought this month we could take a step back and practice a more practical kata.
As the blog linked above explains we will be building a basic web application using
phoenix that allows users to register with a username and password, and lets existing
users log in and out. To follow suit with our previous katas protecting a certain route
from unauthenticated users will be for more experienced users, but beginners are always
welcome to tackle it! (hint: look into phoenix's function plugs)
